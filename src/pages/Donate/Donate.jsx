Your gift to Life Quilt Foundation can be matched by an equal or larger gift from your company. It is a real win-win for you, your employer and the students served by Life Quilt. To help Life Quilt Foundation receive a match to your gift, contact your Human Resources office to get your matching gift form or to learn if your company provides online requests. Help us help our students in need."
