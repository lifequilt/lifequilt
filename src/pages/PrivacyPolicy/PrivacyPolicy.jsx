    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
    Life Quilt Foundation is committed to respecting the privacy of our donors and pledges its best efforts to that end. In general, you can visit Life Quilt Foundation on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing anything about yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our Web server automatically recognizes each visitor’s domain name, but does not automatically collect personally identifiable information. There are times, however, such as when you make a donation, sign up to volunteer or register for our email list, that we will collect specific information. If you choose to provide personally identifiable data, you may receive future information from us–by mail or electronically – advising you of upcoming Life Quilt Foundation events, services, or volunteer and support opportunities. We do not “share,” “rent,” or “sell” any information collected on our website.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, donor information – which includes address, phone, and email –collected through offline channels by Life Quilt Foundation is not shared, rented or sold to any other organizations. Donor information provided to Life Quilt will only be used by the Life Quilt for purposes of furthering our mission.
    </p>

    <h3>Credit Card information</h3>

    <p>
    Life Quilt Foundation has contracted the services of a banking partner to process credit card and debit card donations submitted online. Our banking partner’s secured server encrypts your credit card information so that it may be safely transmitted over the Web. Your credit card information will not be released to any other party by Life Quilt Foundation or our banking partner.

    <h2>The Donor Bill of Rights</h2>

    <p>
    Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
    </p>

    <p>
    I. To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
    II. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
    III. To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.
    </p>

    <p>
    IV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.
    </p>

    <p>
    V. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
    VI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.
    </p>

    <p>
    VII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.
    </p>

    <p>
    VIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.
    </p>

    <p>
    IX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.
    </p>

    <p>
